## 🌐 **Deployment Instructions**

### **1. Environment Variables (Required)**

Set these in your deployment platform (Netlify/Vercel):

```env
# Required
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_supabase_key
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Optional Features
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_ENABLE_SENTRY=true
VITE_ENABLE_OFFLINE=true
VITE_MAX_RETRIES=3
VITE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30000
```

### **2. Netlify Deployment**

The project is pre-configured for Netlify deployment:

```toml
# netlify.toml already configured with:
- Build command: npm run build
- Publish directory: dist
- Security headers configured
- Redirect rules for SPA
- Environment-specific settings
```

**Deploy Steps:**
1. Connect repository to Netlify
2. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
3. Deploy from `main` branch
4. Verify deployment at your domain

### **3. Manual Deployment**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Facely1er/edusoluceportal.git
cd edusoluceportal

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy dist/ folder to your hosting provider
```
