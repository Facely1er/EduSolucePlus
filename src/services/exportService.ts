## Overview
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal privacy law that gives parents certain protections with regard to their children's education records.

## 1. FERPA Overview and Scope

### Who Must Comply
- Public elementary and secondary schools
- Most private schools
- Colleges and universities
- Any educational institution receiving federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education

### What FERPA Protects
- Privacy of student education records
- Parent and eligible student rights
- Controls over information disclosure
- Access to education records

### Enforcement and Penalties
- Enforced by Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO)
- Penalties include loss of federal education funding
- Investigations and compliance reviews
- No private right of action for monetary damages

## 2. Education Records Definition and Management

### Definition of Education Records
- Definition: Records directly related to a student and maintained by an educational institution
- Must contain personally identifiable information about the student
- Must be maintained by the educational institution or party acting for the institution

### What IS an Education Record
- Academic transcripts and grade reports
- Standardized test scores
- Disciplinary records filed with administration
- Special education files and IEPs
- Health records maintained by school
- Financial aid records
- Admission records
- Attendance records

### What is NOT an Education Record
- Sole possession records (personal notes not shared)
- Law enforcement unit records
- Employment records (for student employees)
- Physician/psychiatrist treatment records
- Alumni records created after graduation
- Peer-graded papers before collected by teacher

### Record Storage and Security
- Implement appropriate physical security measures
- Use locked filing cabinets for paper records
- Secure digital storage with access controls

3. **Right to Hearing** - If amendment request is denied
4. **Right to File Complaints** - With FPCO if rights are violated
5. **Right to Control Disclosures** - Generally required consent for disclosure

### Rights Transfer
- Rights belong to parents until student turns 18
- Rights transfer to student at 18 OR when attending postsecondary institution
- "Eligible students" are those 18+ or attending postsecondary
- Both parents and eligible students have rights at postsecondary level

### Procedures for Rights Requests

#### Inspection Requests
1. Must be in writing (can be email)
2. Must specify records to be inspected
3. Respond within 45 days maximum
4. May charge reasonable fee for copies
5. Must provide access during normal business hours

#### Amendment Requests
1. Must be in writing with specific concerns
2. Respond within reasonable time
